### Hi there 👋

I’m currently learning JS online.

I decided to start with this language for two reasons:

- the obvious one, I'm interested in web development (full stack);
- as a junior developer, I want to get a job.

If you are unsure about JS (I was), I strongly recommend watching this video on Youtube:

[3 Reasons why you SHOULDN’T become a full-stack developer (and what you should study instead)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgEVfaDmfTk)


And before starting, I beg you to google about these two terms: 

- ***"Tutorial Hell"*** 🔥

- ***"Imposter Syndrome"***

Maybe, You (like me) got stuck in Tutorial Hell 😱 !!!

So, like the ***Super Size Me*** movie, I will follow this "diet" for  3 (three) months and compare my results at the end. 

To get into JS, I chose these two courses on Udemy from Jonas Schmedtmann:

- 🎖️ ***The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!*** (⭐4.7  stars) 
- 🎖️ ***Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS***    (⭐4.8  stars) 

At this moment, I am interested in becoming a front-end developer, then libraries like [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) I will study later.

The same logic can be applied to the main JS frameworks like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). 

I also signed up in [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)  to practice algorithm and programming logic exercises.

For those who want a book reference, I will try this one - **Javascript: The Definitive Guide by O'Reilly**.

So, let's begin!
